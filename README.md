## KosumosuTeashop ##

This app demonstrates AngularJS as used to build a shopping cart
for a teashop website.

The project is broken down according to the John Papa Angular style
guide (or as close as makes sense for its scope).

The user can browse teas by category, search for specific teas, and
add/remove them from their shopping cart. When they are satisfied
they can verify the teas and quantities at the checkout page
before finalizing the order.
